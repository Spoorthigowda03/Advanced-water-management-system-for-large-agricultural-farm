# Advanced Water Management System for Large Agricultural Farm 
<details>
<summary><h2> Abstract </h2> </summary>
<br>
  
#### An advanced water management system for agricultural farms(more than 50 acre with different crops with different water requirements) optimizes irrigation by usingsensors and IoT to monitor soil moisture and weather conditions, ensuring efficient water usage and crop health. The system supports sustainable farming, and enhances crop yield through precise data-driven irrigation management.

<summary><h2> Objectives</h2> </summary>
<br>

#### Develop a state-of-the-art water management system that adheres to BIS standards to improve irrigation efficiency, adapt to environmental changes, and integrate advanced technology.
#### Aims to implement a comprehensive water management system that achieves the following objectives.
 Optimized Irrigation Practices
 Adaptability to Environmental Variability:Managing varying soil types, terrain conditions, and erratic water availability.
 Integration of Technology

<summary><h2> Components</h2> </summary>
<br>


### Sensors and Devices
Soil Moisture Sensors :Measure the amount of water present in the soil, providing valuable data for optimizing irrigation and understanding soil conditions.
Water Level Indicators :Provide a practical solution for farmers to monitor water levels accurately and efficiently.
Weather Sensors(DHT22) :Weather sensors play a crucial role in optimizing water use, improving crop yields, and ensuring sustainability

### Sustainable Power Supply
Solar pannels :The system uses solar panels to generate electricity and power a submersible pump that pumps water from a bore well to a storage tank. 
Battery backup:During fault weather conditions when solar pannels also doesn’t support.

<summary><h2>BIS Standards </h2> </summary>
<br>

IS 10804 :1986 -Recommended pumping system for agriculture purpose.
IS 11810:1986 –Guidline to establish a value engineering activity(precise moisture management ,increase the functionality and quality)
IS 7722:1975 – Analog pneumatic signal for process control system.(automatic valves controller , mainly concentrate on pressure and flow of the water)
IS 13703:2018 – Controllers for centralized management of irrigation schedule.
IS 8985:1978 – Recommended for weather monitoring system.

<summary><h2>Expected Benifits </h2> </summary>
<br>
  
Optimized Irrigation Practices
Water efficiency
Improved soil health

<details>
<summary><h2>Conclusion </h2> </summary>
<br>

Hence ,by using advanced integrated  technology (interfacing various sensors and actuators) an effective method for water management system is developed for diversed range of crops by eliminating the problems faced by traditional irrigation method.

Utilising the BIS Standards the components will get the standardization ,certification and quality which inturn gives better life time usage of the components.
